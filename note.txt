// If you get vercel deployment error that looks like below:
This Serverless Function has crashed.

Your connection is working correctly.

Vercel is working correctly.

Check your build log to be sure what the problem is
- It could be you need to replace import paths from "src/home" to "../home" replace "src" with ".."
- Better still update Jest configuration in package.json with the following
{
  ...
  "jest": {
    ...
    "rootDir": "./",
    "modulePaths": [
      "<rootDir>"
    ],
    ...
  }
}
- It could be due to prisma post install script. include the following in your package.json:
{
  ...
  "scripts" {
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
  ...
}
- It could be you need to "pnpm install -D @types/jsonwebtoken" to fix a jwt.decode is not a function error. And also import it like so:

import jwt from "jsonwebtoken" (works only in production)

instead of

import * as jwt from "jsonwebtoken" (works only in development)
